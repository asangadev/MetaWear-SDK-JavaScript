Introduction
=================
The MetaWear Javascript API provides a simple way to communicate with your MetaWear boards using Apple devices.  

This is a thin wrapper around the `MetaWear C++ API <https://github.com/mbientlab/MetaWear-SDK-Cpp>`_ so you will find the `C++ documentation <https://mbientlab.com/cppdocs/latest/>`_ and `API reference <https://mbientlab.com/docs/metawear/cpp/latest/globals.html>`_ useful.

If you are interested in the finer details of the library, see `source code <https://github.com/mbientlab/MetaWear-SDK-iOS-macOS-tvOS>`_ and `API documentation <https://mbientlab.com/docs/metawear/ios/latest/>`_.

This guide assumes you have fundamental knowledge of Javascript programming especially `Node.JS <https://nodejs.org/en/>`_.
